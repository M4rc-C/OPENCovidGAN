### About

It is simply a project that I realized in the field of my studies. It is a free implementation of the CovidGAN project that I made from the research report that is available here.: https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.05094

CovidGAN is an ACGAN designed to generate a chest x-ray dataset to allow better detection of Covid-19 via CNNs.
